# Stochastic Nested Bandits

This repository provides a stochastic environment for simulating interactions in the context of **Nested Bandits** â€” a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem with a hierarchical or nested structure.

## Overview

The project aims to model and simulate decision-making scenarios where actions are nested and feedback is obtained in a stochastic manner. It serves as a testbed for developing and evaluating algorithms designed to solve the **Stochastic Nested Bandit Problem**, which arises in various real-world applications such as recommendation systems, online advertising, and hierarchical decision processes.
